# SparkKit Receipts — snap, extract, organise

Receipt capture. Take a photo of a receipt, a connected server (running
`server.py`, backed by Claude) reads it and extracts structured data —
merchant, date, total, GST, category, line items — and it's kept in sync
between the phone and the server so you can search it, see monthly/category
totals, and export CSV for your accountant or spreadsheet.

## How it works

1. **Settings → Ledger sync** → enter your server's URL and bearer token,
   then Save & sync. This is the only required setup step — the phone needs
   no API key, and connects to *any* compatible server, not
   just one specific one (so the same app can be handed to a different
   client pointed at their own agent). The details are saved on the phone
   and reconnect automatically every time the app is opened.
2. **Scan** → take a photo (or pick several from your gallery). Each image
   is downscaled on-device, uploaded to the server for extraction, and the
   result is cached in IndexedDB with a small thumbnail.
3. **Receipts** → search and filter by month/category, tap a receipt to
   review it. Extracted fields are locked (they're what the receipt says);
   only the category and notes can be changed. Export the current view as CSV.
4. **Totals** → spend and GST per month, broken down by category.

Scanning is disabled with a prompt until a server is connected (or a
fallback key is saved — see below).

## Design decisions

- **Server-side extraction by default.** `POST /receipts/extract` picks a
  backend automatically: the **openclaw CLI** when installed (rides the
  box's existing agent/model account — no API key at all), else the
  Anthropic API via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. See `SERVER_API.md`. The phone is
  a thin sync client over IndexedDB.
- **Optional device fallback.** Settings → Advanced accepts an Anthropic
  key that's used only when the server can't extract; leave it empty to
  rely on the server alone.
- **Strict JSON contract** (`contract.py`) either way — structured outputs
  on Anthropic, an inline-schema prompt on OpenClaw.

## Run it

From the repo root, serve the static app and a local API:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 5173 &
SPARKKIT_RECEIPTS_TOKEN=dev-token python3 receipts/server.py
# (set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... if the openclaw CLI isn't installed locally)
# then open http://localhost:5173/receipts/ and connect Settings → Ledger sync
# to http://localhost:8787 with token "dev-token"
```

> ⚠️ The camera and service worker need a secure context: `localhost` is fine
> for development; use HTTPS (e.g. the deployed vhost, see `deploy/DEPLOY.md`) on a phone.

## Server

- [`SERVER_API.md`](SERVER_API.md) — endpoint reference.
- [`server.py`](server.py) — stdlib HTTP + SQLite API.
- [`receipt_cli.py`](receipt_cli.py), [`CHAT_INTAKE.md`](CHAT_INTAKE.md) —
  chat/CLI intake (Ledger's Discord/iCloud flow).

## Roadmap

- Optional cheaper model toggle for bulk back-scanning of old receipts.
- Attach receipts to jobs (ties into the planned invoicing feature).
- Full-size image retention (currently only a thumbnail is kept).
